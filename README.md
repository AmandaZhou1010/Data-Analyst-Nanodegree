# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
This repository is about the five projects I have completed from Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

This program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I have been developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I built a portfolio of projects.


## Course 1: Introduction to Data Analysis
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Anaconda
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Data Analysis Process
* Pandas and AND NumPy:Case Study 1 & 2
* Programming Workflow for Data Analysis

### Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends
This project introduces the SQL and how to download data from a database. I’ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

### Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset
In this project, I’ll choose one of Udacity’s curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas. I’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.


## Course 2: Practical Statistics
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B test and building supervised learning models.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Simpson’s Paradox
* Probability
* Binomial Distribution
* Conditional Probability
* Bayes Rule
* Standardizing
* Sampling Distributions and Central Limit Theorem
* Confidence Intervals
* Hypothesis Testing
* T-Tests and A/B Tests
* Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression

### Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results
For this project, I'll be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. I’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.


## Course 3: Data Wrangling
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Gathering Data: 
  * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs.
  * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files.
  * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database.
* Assessing Data:
  * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas.
  * Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues).
  * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity.
* Cleaning Data:
  *  Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding, and testing).
  * Clean data using Python and pandas.
  * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python.
  
### Project 4 - Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, I’ll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. I’ll document my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.


## Course 4: Data Visualization with Python
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

**Learning Outcomes**
* Design of Visualizations
* Univariate Exploration of Data
* Bivariate Exploration of Data
* Multivariate Exploration of Data
* Explanatory Visulizations
* Visulization Case Study

### Poject 5 - Communicate Data Findings
I'll choose a dataset and perform an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then, create a presentation with explanatory plots that conveys my findings.
